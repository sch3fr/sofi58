# sofi58
Since I didn't want to wait for a Sofle mechanical keyboard kit to arrive during holidays I decided to create a handwired and 3d printed clone of the Sofle keyboard. \
While I will provide all the files and build guide, I do not expect anyone to build this. This keyboard is gonna be a shittier version of original, since I'm speedruning the build and I'm very much winging it based on my limited skills in tinkercad and whatever kind of hardware I find in my drawers.

## Progress
So far I have most of the keyboard printed and I'll start wiring soon. The keyboard will run on QMK and Vial.
~~I'll post updates tommorow, I'm tired now, spent 4 hours lubing switches and getting no bi~~  \
